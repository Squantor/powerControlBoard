## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
Most of my parts are sourced from LCSC, it seems the lowest effort way to get components at an affordable price.
* Hilink 12V module
* Triac
* 12V stepdown converter IC's
* Optocoupler
*
